This created problems as we couldn't use these IDs to save data about our engine created objects and to link any objects to other parts of the engine (such as node scripting).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The solution was to allow for the scenes handling to be handled completely from our engine. This included serialization and deserialization of scenes using Json.\n  </p>",

The events are consequently polled every frame to check if the condition has been met, and if so, the action is executed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",

The core of the system is having a base class called \"<strong>Action</strong>\" and have different behaviors derive from this class.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    At the moment an action is executed it will register itself to a static container that handles the execution of the current active actions. The action will then update until it thinks that it doesn't need to update anymore meaning the action itself decides when it will stop updating.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The system becomes more useful when implementing different \"<strong>Composite Actions</strong>\", such as \"<strong>ActionSequence</strong>\" and \"<strong>ActionDependency</strong>\", the first mentioned simply updating the actions in order and the latter updating all actions at once until all have finished executing.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The above problem could then be solved using an \"ActionSequence\" that contains the behaviors in order.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://broremilolofsson.github.io/media/posts/5/screen-capture-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter-2.gif\" height=\"225\" width=\"400\" alt=\"\" >\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h3 id=\"unity-tools\">\n      Unity Tools\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The scripted events in the game was created by level designers as it created a more modular pipeline.
